## CS-210 Portfolio Projects

This repository contains my projects from my time in CS-210: Programming Languages. Each project exhibits my ability to write safe, efficient, and maintainable code in C++. Although I came into the course with prior programming experience in JavaScript, Python, jQuery, and their libraries, working with C++ challenged me to approach familiar concepts in a lower level, strongly typed environment. This helped me increase my understanding of memory management, efficiency, and best practices in structured programming.

### [Project 1 (P1) – Clockering Time](./P1%20Clockering%20Time/)

**Summary:**
This project calculated and displayed time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats while handling user input and formatting requirements.

**Reflection:**
- **What I did well:** I kept my code modular and readable by separating formatting logic into functions.
- **Enhancements:** I could improve input validation to handle unexpected or invalid entries more gracefully.
- **Challenges:** Getting the time formatting correct without off-by-one errors took testing and debugging, but breaking the logic into smaller functions solved it.
- **Transferable skills:** This reinforced the importance of modular design and formatting, which applies across all programming languages.

### [Project 2 (P2) – Airgead Banking App](./P2%20Airgead%20Banking%20App/)


**Summary:**
This project simulated an investment calculator that showed how balances grow with and without monthly deposits. It involved looping, arithmetic operations, and clear formatted reporting.

**Reflection:**
- **What I did well:** I designed output reports that were easy to read and professional.
- **Enhancements:** I could expand the app to include additional investment options or integrate error handling for non-numeric inputs.
- **Challenges:** The compound interest formula was initially tricky, but I used my math background and pseudocode planning to make the implementation easier.
- **Transferable skills:** I practiced writing financial logic that could be applied to real-world fintech applications.

### [Project 3 (P3) – Grocery Tracking](./P3%20Grocery%20Tracking)


**Summary:**
This project tracked grocery items and their frequencies, reading from an input file and writing frequency data to an output file. It also displayed results in a histogram.

**Reflection:**
- **What I did well:** I implemented file input/output effectively and wrote code that was well-documented and structured.
- **Enhancements:** I could improve efficiency by using unordered maps or alternative data structures for faster lookups.
- **Challenges:** Managing file I/O while ensuring the program handled missing or incorrect files was the hardest part, but testing edge cases solved the issue.
- **Transferable skills:** File handling, data storage, and using maps/dictionaries are concepts that transfer directly to web development and Python work I’ve done before.

### Overall Reflection

While the programming concepts were familiar from my experience in JavaScript, Python, and jQuery, applying them in C++ required me to think differently about memory, efficiency, and type safety. This course helped me grow into a more well-rounded developer by strengthening my ability to:

- Write code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
- Use modular design to make programs easier to test and debug.
- Reflect on challenges and find solutions using documentation, problem decomposition, and prior programming knowledge.

These projects represent important steps in building my portfolio and demonstrate transferable skills that apply across languages, projects, and professional software development.
